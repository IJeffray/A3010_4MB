# Acorn A3010 4MB RAM card

This is my layout update of an A3010 4MB board design originally by Tim Tashpulatov, later updated by Daniel Jameson.

This is my own layout, as an improved 4-layer design, undertaken in Altium, so there's little relation to the original repo now.

The design has proven realiable in several A3010s, including use at 'overclocked' rates up to 20MHz.
